# 📦 Target's Sales Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Target's Sales Data Analysis Project! 🚀  
In this project, I worked with real-world e-commerce transactional datasets, uploaded them into a MySQL database, and performed **15 powerful SQL queries** — covering Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of analysis.

Here's the Kaggle Dataset Link: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv)

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The following CSV files were used:

| CSV File        | Table Name   |
|-----------------|--------------|
| customers.csv   | customers    |
| geolocation.csv | geolocation  |
| order_items.csv | order_items  |
| orders.csv      | orders       |
| sellers.csv     | sellers      |
| products.csv    | products     |
| payments.csv    | payments     |

✅ All CSV files were automatically uploaded into **MySQL** using **Python** with clean column names and accurate data types.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, MySQL Connector)
- MySQL Database
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL (Basic ➔ Advanced)
- Data Cleaning, Loading, and Analysis

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
   - Read CSVs into Pandas DataFrames.
   - Clean and standardize column names.
   - Create MySQL tables dynamically based on inferred data types.
   - Insert all data automatically into the MySQL database.

2. **SQL Analysis**
   - Wrote and executed 15 major SQL queries across 3 difficulty levels:
     - **Basic Queries** 📘
     - **Intermediate Queries** 📗
     - **Advanced Queries** 📕
   - Extracted, analyzed, and visualized business-critical insights.

## 📝 SQL Questions Solved

### 🔹 Basic Queries
1. **List all unique cities** where customers are located.
2. **Count the number of orders placed** in 2017.
3. **Find the total sales** per category.
4. **Calculate the percentage of orders** that were paid in installments.
5. **Count the number of customers** from each state.

---

### 🔸 Intermediate Queries
1. **Calculate the number of orders per month** in 2018.
2. **Find the average number of products per order**, grouped by customer city.
3. **Calculate the percentage of total revenue** contributed by each product category.
4. **Identify the correlation between product price and purchase frequency.**
5. **Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller** and rank them by revenue.

---

### 🔥 Advanced Queries
1. **Calculate the moving average of order values** for each customer over their order history.
2. **Calculate the cumulative sales per month** for each year.
3. **Calculate the year-over-year growth rate** of total sales.
4. **Calculate the customer retention rate**, defined as customers who made a repeat purchase within 6 months.
5. **Identify the top 3 customers** who spent the most money in each year.

## 📈 Visualizations
- Bar plots, line plots, and other data visualizations were created using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** inside the Jupyter Notebook to better understand key trends.

## 📁 How to Run This Project
1. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/musfiqurrabeg/Target-Sales-Analysis.git
```
2. Ensure you have installed the required libraries:
```
pip install numpy pandas mysql-connector-python matplotlib seaborn

3. Update your **MySQL credentials** in the Python script (`user`, `password`, `host`, etc.).
4. Place all CSV files inside the specified folder.
5. Run the Jupyter Notebook step-by-step.
6. Explore and enjoy the insights!
